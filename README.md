## Disclaimer:
The aim of this project is to learn the basics of python, it's selenium library, and consecutively the chrome driver tools used for basic web automation and automation testing. It also aims to test the bot and other automated software detection and banning systems of instagram.

## Description:
A web automation software created using the Selenium library of Python and chrome driver tools to mimic a bot, that logs in to the instagram account with the given credentials, and can do humane actions like, following a particular account, liking, commenting and interacting with other posts, and sending a direct message to a particular user.

## Motivation:
This project was created mainly to teach myself about web automation using python and selenium. Since web automation is a vast field, and I wanted to explore this field, I chose to create an instagram bot as to shorten my learning time and not to focus on the wrong thing. Since I am already a heavy Instagram user and therefore I thought it would be an interesting challenge to tackle. Moreover, as I have been invested in front end web development in the past, I was motivated to do this project, as I got to put those skills to use to learn new skills.
