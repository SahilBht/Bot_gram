## Disclaimer:
The aim of this project is to learn the basics of python, it's selenium library, and consecutively the chrome driver tools used for basic web automation and automation testing. It also aims to test the bot and other automated software detection and banning systems of instagram.

## Description:
A web automation software created using the Selenium library of Python and chrome driver tools to mimic a bot, that logs in to the instagram account with the given credentials, and can do humane actions like, following a particular account, liking, commenting and interacting with other posts, and sending a direct message to a particular user.

## Motivation:
This project was created mainly to teach myself about web automation using python and selenium. Since web automation is a vast field, and I wanted to explore this field, I chose to create an instagram bot as to shorten my learning time and not to focus on the wrong thing. Since I am already a heavy Instagram user and therefore I thought it would be an interesting challenge to tackle. Moreover, as I have been invested in front end web development in the past, I was motivated to do this project, as I got to put those skills to use to learn new skills.

## Tech/Libraries used:
* Python
* Selenium
* Chrome Web driver

## Installation
To install the Instagram bot, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the appropriate webdriver (chromedriver or geckodriver) and add to PATH
4. Create a config.py file and add your Instagram account credentials and bot settings

## Features
* Login to Instagram using user credentials
* Follow, like, comment, and message other users
* Multi-threading and other optimizations to improve performance
* Error-handling and exception-handling mechanisms to minimize downtime

## Usage
To use the Instagram bot, simply run the bot.py file using Python. This will start the bot and it will perform the actions specified in the config.py file. You can also modify the config file to adjust the bot's settings and actions.
